# Neutron: New Tron

Neutron is a basic Tron game written in C. It utilizes the ncurses library for displaying simple terminal text-based graphics. I built Neutron as a fun side project when I was at the University of Central Florida in 2016 learning the C Programming Language as part of my Computer Science curriculum.
